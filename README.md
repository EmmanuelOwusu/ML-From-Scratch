## Linear Regression 

* Linear regression is used to predict the continuous dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.

* Linear Regression is used for solving Regression problem.

* In Linear regression, we predict the value of continuous variables

## Logistic Regression 

* Logistic Regression is used to predict the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.

* Logistic regression is used for solving Classification problems.

* In logistic Regression, we predict the values of categorical variables.
